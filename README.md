# widget-to-image

A Flutter utility to convert any widget into image using Render Object. 

> This example is to take down notes and set it as a wallpaper

## Getting Started

1. Write your own `CaptureWidget` in captureWidget.dart. 
2. On clicking the `check` icon, all that is visibly part of your CaptureWidget will be returned to you as a BytesList
3. Here, I have further used this BytesList to set it as wallpaper of my device. 

> Essentially taking a screeshot of your widgets. It can be as specific a widget you want. Need not be entire screen.
